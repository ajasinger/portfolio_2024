This could have been accomplished with a number of joined tables and filtering on the front-end but I realized that would result in a lot of calls to Supabase and reduced security so I used two Supabase features: Row Level Security (RLS) and JWTs. JWTs allowed me to attach the organizations they're a member of and their role to the metadata of a token so I could easily check their membership without calling the database. With RLS I could also check this metadata against table data so any data they don't have access to can not be sent to the front-end, adding a layer of security. I did experience an issue where right after the organization was created access was inconsistent, which turned out to be because the JWT wasn't updated to so I had to refresh the token before moving the user to their dashboard.

I incorporated useContext to set a platform-wide state for the current organization as that affected many components in the app. I then realized users would want to view their most recent organization when they logged back in to our platform so I added a last_organization to the profiles table and checked it to set the context as soon as they logged in. The downside to useContext is that I had move a number of database calls from server components to client components to access context and switch out the organization accordingly, but I decided that loss in efficiency was outweighed by avoiding prop drilling."

                title: "Webhooks:",
                body: "After a user connected an email I needed to track emails as they hit the user's inbox. I set up a Nylas webhook to notify my when a new email hit the users inbox, but I couldn't figure out how to then get the protected access tokens from Supabase to get additional data on the email. My first approach was setting up a useEffect so the next time a user logged in I could grab the access token, get the necessary data and sed it to the ML endpoint to generate a fraud score. This, however, didn't allow us to alert users as soon as the email hit the inbox. Ii discovered that I could use a Supabase service role key to bypass RLS to get the necessary data even when a relevant user wasn't logged in so I tried a cron job that would periodically check if new email id's had been added to the table and send them to the ML endpoint, but this was inefficient. I realized I could use Supabase to set up a webhook that would trigger a function every time a new email id was added to the table, that would generate a fraud score and notify the user if the fraud score was above a certain threshold."

Since, from early on, I had broken up my code into reusable components, it was easy to adapt to all these changes.",

I did come up with a few naming conventions like 'user' and 'organization', as the product changed and the complexity grew and developed, there were some inconsistencies. Now that I have seen how a system grows I'll be better equipped to plan accordingly."

I learned of a few places that weren't intuitive so I completely restructured the flow after a user logs in, which greatly improved understanding and I believe will improve conversion.",
                learnings: "Have users test the product regularly instead of waiting until it's almost complete, identifying other milestones where user interaction could help inform the design and product moving forward."
